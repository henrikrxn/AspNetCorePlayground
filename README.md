# ResumeService

Spare time project building a resume Web service based on a super-set of the Json resume [schema](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/blob/master/schema.json).

Goals:

- Have example of stuff I need at work every X years and have to do from scratch each time.
- Have a non-trivial project to use for experiments with programming language, tooling, etc.
