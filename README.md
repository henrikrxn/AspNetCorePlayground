# AspNetCorePlayground

Spare time project that does nothing useful except being a playground for experimenting with different ways of doing the same thing

Hoping that I'll have:

- examples of stuff I need at work every X years and have to do from scratch each time.
- a project to use for experiments with programming language, tooling, etc.
