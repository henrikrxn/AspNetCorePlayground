# Sticking to existing scheme for dependency management of NuGet packages

## Context: System infrastructure / plumbing

Would very much want to try the new [feature](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/Central-Package-Management) for centrally managing NuGet packages.

## Decisions

1. Try the feature.

### Rationale

There is is a good chance that this will be the way going forward or at the very least a step in the right direction.

## Status

I am the sole stakeholder so "Approved".

Will revisting decision if there ever is significant movement on this.

## Consequences

Positive:

- I know the current tooling and how to use it properly.
- I am the only developer so versioning drift will be minimal.

Negative: None other than begin stuck with the current tooling.
