# C# for backend

## Context: Programming language

The backend will be in C#, starting with .NET 5 and moving to .NET 6 as soon as that is released as LTS.

## Decisions

1. Use C# for backend

### Rationale

C# is what I have used professionally for the last 10 years and the backend is not where I want to experiment with this project.

## Status

I am the sole stakeholder so "Approved".

## Consequences

Positive: I know C# so will be more effective.

Negative: Will not learn much new on the backend side, but there are plenty of oppotunities for learning on the front-end side, CI/CD, provisioning and deployment.
