# Walking skeleton / tracer bullet

## Context: Technical verification and project kick-start

The concept is far from new originally coined by Alistair Cockburn (Walking skeleton in the book "Crystal Clear") and also mentioned in the "Pragmatic Programmer" as "Tracer bullet".

## Decisions

1. Create a walking skeleton for a simple feature.

### Rationale

Getting infrastructure, tests, CI/CD and deployment up and running from the start reduces the loop time.

See "Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Anniversary Edition" and "Crystal Clear" for the rationale. No reason for me to repeat that here.

## Status

I am the sole stakeholder so "Approved".

## Consequences

Positive: Can see things working early on. Can experiment with new things and techniques from early on and still be sure to have a deployable system.

Negative: Will be some time before I get to features and functionality.
